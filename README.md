# React working with Golden Layout

This is based on a project I did to get the minimal tooling up and running to support React and Redux development.

## Installation

First, run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

Then, you can run `npm test` to run some (unbelievably trivial) tests.

Finally, you can run `webpack` to compile all JSX, etc. into the `index.js` file.  Open `index.html` in the browser of your choice, and it all should work.
 
Also, you can run `webpack --watch` to have `webpack` automagically rebuild things when you change a file.  It's not hot reloading, you still have to refresh your browser.
