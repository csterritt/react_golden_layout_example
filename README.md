# React working with Golden Layout

This is based on a project I did to get the minimal tooling up and running to support React and Redux development, following [Pete Hunt's awesome webpack setup tutorial](https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto).

However, I have removed the Redux stuff, to simplify the example, and show how it works with just React.

## Installation

First, run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

Then, you can run `npm test` to run some (unbelievably trivial) tests.

Finally, you can run `webpack` to compile all JSX, etc. into the `index.js` file.  Open `index.html` in the browser of your choice, and it all should work.
 
There are a lot of other `webpack` command line options, see the webpack tutorial above.
